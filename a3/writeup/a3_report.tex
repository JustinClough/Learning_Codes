\section*{Algorithm Description}

\subsection*{Operation 1} \label{sec:sub:op1}

The number of mesh regions for each part was determined by 
first iterating over all mesh vertices. For each mesh vertex, 
its third dimensional adjacencies, surrounding mesh regions, were 
collected into a temporary vector. The contents of this temporary 
vector were then added to another data structure if it did not 
already exist in the other structure. The size of this data 
structure was then the number of regions on each part. The mesh
vertices were then iterated over again. For each mesh vertex, 
it was first checked if it was owned by the operating process. 
If it was owned, then the local and global identification numbers 
were recorded. The number of adjacent regions was recorded as well 
for each vertex.

\subsection*{Operation 2} \label{sec:sub:op2}

A similar process as shown in Operation 1 was used. The number of
mesh faces for each part was determined by first iterating over all mesh
vertices. For each mesh vertex, 
its first dimensional adjacencies, surrounding mesh edges, were 
collected into a temporary vector. The contents of this temporary 
vector were then added to another data structure if it did not 
already exist in the other structure. The size of this data 
structure was then the number of edges on each part. The mesh
vertices were then iterated over again. For each mesh vertex, 
it was first checked if it was owned by the operating process. 
If it was owned, then the local and global identification numbers 
were recorded. The number of adjacent faces was recorded as well 
for each vertex.
